# javascript-challenge

### Background

The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at ALIENS-R-REAL have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it!

In this challenge, I have written a code using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js, that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset provided. Also users are allowed to filter the table data for specific values.

## Tasks
#### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search

* Created a basic HTML web page.index.html.

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
  - I have a column for 
 i:  date/time, 
ii:  city, 
iii: state, 
iv: country, 
 v: shape, 
vi: comment 
  
  at the very least.
