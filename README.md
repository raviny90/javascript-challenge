### Background

The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at ALIENS-R-REAL have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it!

In this challenge, I have written a code using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js, that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset provided. Also users are allowed to filter the table data for specific values.

### Discription Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

Common files static/css/style.css -- style sheet for webpage static/images/ufo1.png -- main image for webpage static/js/data.js -- provided UFO dataset for the assignment

#### 1: UFO Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search

* Created a basic HTML web page.index.html.
files index.html -- UFO Finder webpage (date search) static/js/app.js -- JavaScript for index.html webpage functionality

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting. - I have columns for 
 i:  date/time, 
ii:  city, 
iii: state, 
iv: country,

  at the very least.
