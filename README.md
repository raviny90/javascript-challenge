# javascript-challenge

### Background

The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at ALIENS-R-REAL have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it!

In this challenge, I have written a code using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js, that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset provided. Also users are allowed to filter the table data for specific values.

## Tasks
Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search
Create a basic HTML web page.index.html.

Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
